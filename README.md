# SWE-Clinic-Finder-Project
This is a copy of my group project done for software engineering. 

The basic function of the website is to find the most optimal clinic based on proximity, crowd condition, symptoms and conditions treated by the clinic.

The functionality of the website was extended for registered patient accounts to keep track of past and future appointments, store health information and make appointments with registered clinics.

Clinics can also create an account to accept or reject appointments and retrieve health information of patients to inform and prepare the staff and doctors beforehand.

Through this project, we learned how to perform encapsulation to prevent the leakage of sensitive data. 

We also applied the principle of modularity to maximise the reusability of each component, making it easy to maintain and upgrade
